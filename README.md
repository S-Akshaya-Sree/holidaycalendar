This project uses the Python programming language. Following are the components present in the code: 

1. Nested dictionaries to store details of festivals per month. 

2. It includes checks for input validation.

3. The data structure Linked list has been implemented using Python classes

4. And finally, tkinter GUI has been used for a pleasant user interaction.

On execution, a yearly calendar appears, and on clicking on a specific date, one can check whether that particular day is a national holiday or not, and the immediate previous and next holidays in that month.
